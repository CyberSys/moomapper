1. Introduction
-------------------------

I am making this source code available to the public so some people might be able to 
further aid the gta and vice city modding community. To answer some questions which
I guess will be asked:



Q: Why are the comments short/crap/non existent
---
A: The source was never intended to be released to the general public, and was all
put together as a hobby to further my education and to help people mod..



Q: Why is there so little information about what and how the source works?
---
A: Same reason as above, I might follow up the code release with some info
to help developers if they need it



Q: I have found a way to fix/improve this, will you make it available on your site
---
A: If you send me the code of the bits changed, then I might occasionally piece
the bits together and make available a modified version on my site. I will of course
name you as a contributer.



Q: Why dont you just run an open source project for this?
---
A: I dont plan on maintaining this much, and the code isnt really all that great
and there probably isnt that much interest any more.



Q: Why dont you respond to your email, I keep thinking you are dead.
---
A: Job & girlfriend & too many emails :) For some reason I havent found much time
to do any computer programming outside of work. 



Q: The code is appauling, a 6 year old girl could have done a better job!
---
A: It was never meant to be perfect, but does the job, and I never saw that
girl write a similar program..

2. Usage Notes
-------------------------

You need to know Delphi, and need to know it well to follow my not very well commented
code. You will also need an understanding of opengl if you are going to be changing 
the 3d views and things. The 'KEd.dpr' is the main project file which you open with
Delphi. I used Delphi 7, and should work with any version of Delphi 7 or higher.

3. Distribution Notes
-------------------------

I hope that this source code provides some use to those who are trying to develop
modifications for both GTA III and Vice City. This source is to be freely distributed
and can be modified as long as it retains reference to myself KCow (Alastair Burr.
I take no responsibility for any damage caused by usage of this or any modified
versions of this product (Though I sincerely hope that nothing like this would happen)

If you have a legitimate question about the source (which shows you have at least tried
to understand what is going on) then feel free to contact me, and if you are lucky then
you will get a response! 

Thank you
